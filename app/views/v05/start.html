        <p>The Dart Charge provides vital funds for ongoing transport improvements, including at the Dartford Crossing itself. Around 50 million crossings are successfully paid for each year. Thanks for paying and doing your part.</p>

          {{ govukWarningText({
            text: "You must pay the Dart Charge by midnight the day after you cross, otherwise you'll get a penalty charge. Crossing charges apply from 6am to 10pm every day of the year.",
            iconFallbackText: "Warning"
        }) }}

        <p>You must pay for non-UK registered vehicles as well as those from the UK.</p>

        <p>Find out about <a href="charges-and-penalties">charges, discounts and penalties</a>, including crossings for which there is no charge. How much you pay depends on the type of vehicle and if you already have an account. <a href="#">Sign in to your account</a> if you have one.</p>
